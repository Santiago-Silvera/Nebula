# NEBULA Engine

NEBULA is a **C-only** rendering engine built from the ground up by a solo developer. The project is currently in its **early stages** and aims to become a **fast, efficient** engine for creating games and simulations.

### Inspiration
NEBULA draws inspiration from the **KOHI Engine** and follows **Victor Gordan's OpenGL tutorial series**. However, the project strives to establish its own identity by prioritizing performance, simplicity, and flexibility.

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to help improve NEBULA, feel free to submit issues and pull requests.
